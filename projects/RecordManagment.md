As a class project, I created a C++ program that acts as a record management system. The program had functionality add, delete, and modify records, look up and print record information to screen, and to write-to and load-from a database file. The program utilized a linked list of structured records.

The program is adapted from a project from earlier in the semester in the C-language, which had slightly different specifications, and which was in turn was the culmination of several earlier assignments. Aside from learning program structure and C/C++ capabilities, I learned techniques for, iteration, regression testing, test analysis, and the distinct advantages of object-oriented vs top-down programming. The project also modeled the client-developer relationship, so that we learned planning and requirement analysis, as well as communication and documentation in case of ambiguous or counter-intuitive specifications from the client.
