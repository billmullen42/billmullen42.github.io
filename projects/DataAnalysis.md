While at Wiley, I proposed and developed a tool to better collate, update, anaylze, and present usage data for publications across the Life Sciences division. The publications I worked on, and most other Wiley Life Sciences publications, used about six different internal and third-party sources for usage metrics. "Usage metrics" in this case was broadly defined to include most measures of success, including pageviews and downloads, submission and acceptance rates of articles, and social media presence. This information is typically presented annually to the Editorial Board Members outside the company, and, in the case of the publications I worked on, analyzed internally on a monthly basis. This is a time consuming task that most editors at Wiley perform.
