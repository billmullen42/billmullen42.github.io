In my four years at Wiley, I acted as system administrator for publications in the [Current Protocols](www.currentprotocols.com) and [WIREs](wires.wiley.com) programs. I was responsible for keeping the copy of both websites up-to-date, as well as maintaining the [Wiley Online Library](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/) pages for these publications (where the full-text of articles is hosted), and for ensuring consistency in the html style. I learned how to troubleshoot system errors, in order to write detailed bug reports.

I was also the primary admin for the [ScholarOne Manuscripts](https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/cp) sites, for these publications, which is their manuscript submission, peer review, and content management system. I created user accounts and manuscript stubs both manually and en-masse, via formatted xml upload. I was also responsible for assisting authors and reviewers who were unfamiliar with the system, and for training new editors.
