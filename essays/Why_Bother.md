Why bother learning Semantic UI, or any UI framework for that matter?

For starters, it takes time and effort to learn a new framework, and you're not doing anything that can't be done in HTML or CSS.When you know the long and hard way to get from point A to point B, it's probably faster to take the long and hard route a second time. Why bother finding shortcuts? After all, the internet doesn't really look any better than it did in 1997. What's the point?

For the record, this is a straw man:

<img class="ui image" src="../images/scarecrow.png">

And that was a straw man argument.

## Just that easy

As I learn more and more tools for software engineering, I like to make a case for the value of what I've learned, weighed against the drawbacks of that framework or language or approach. 
To make my point clear, I can start by playing my former, more naive self. If I can convince him, hopefully I can convince any skeptic as well.

But as my tools get better, it's getting harder to give skepticism a fair shake. For Semantic UI I have a particularly hard time not just because it's useful, but because it's so easy.

## But how?

I think this framwork is quick to pick up by its design, and by its modular nature. 

Even if a framework is large and complicated, it has more in common with a class library than a programming language. It is essentially modular: you can learn and use whatever parts of it you need, and dispense with the rest. Not knowing or misunderstanding some part of the framework limits what you can do, but it's unlikely to break your code.

And, supposing you do need some component you had forgone learning, that's where the design of Semantic UI comes in. Semantic claims, as a main selling point, to focus on natural language in its syntax. It does a fair job of delivering on that promise, so if you don't know the name of the component you need, it will often be your first guess. Plus, there is a lot of leeway when using a piece you're not familiar with. If a class from a library isn't behaving as expected, you can turn to the documentation. For a UI framework, the documentantion is one way to solve your problem, but you also have the option of just tweaking the attributes in your own CSS stylesheet.

So here the idea of "close enough" actually counts for something. What other software tools can make that claim?
