Screenwriter: Thank you for this opportuninty, I'll get right into it. What we have here is a spin on the classic coming of age tale. Our screenplay begins with a chance encounter between our hero and destiny, when he meets a powerful being that fell from the sky, an exile from the Land of Stable Builds. Once one of many meteors, this particular one is destined - some say cursed - to be the fabled Meteorite.
Panelist 1: I'm sorry, meteor, Meteorite?
S: Right, the Meteorite is a meteor that has crashed to Earth.
Panelist 2: In the books, doesn't the Meteorite crash several times? It seemed to be happening almost constantly?
S: Glad to have a fan of the source material! And that's the case here too, but the screenplay glosses over that part a bit.

## Our Journey Begins

S: You see, our villain is the evil wizard that lives in the Tower of Seven Windows. Our hero, together with Meteorite, believes that somewhere in that wizard's tower lies the key to restoring Meteorite to its rightful place in the sky. But the wizard has stolen the Meteorite's magic weapon, a sword named Mongo.
P2: Can you explain the bit about the magic words?
S: Well, the sword Mongo is almost like a part of Meteorite. Usually the Meteorite just calls out "meteor mongo" and the weapon appears, but the wizard's evil magic has severed that tie.
S: So the pair set out, and find a new weapon at their local running shop, and this too they name Mongo. But the old weapon was far superior, powered by magical energies called data objects that Mongo was able to draw from the world around it.
P1: From anywhere?
S: Mostly it would draw power from Metoerite's magical armor or the shell of command. But unable to power the new weapon, the pair venture into the dark and wooded forums seeking answers. The woodland creatures are tricksters, though, and give their secrets only in riddles. But the hero is able to repair the cracks in the weapon's magical scabard, made from a mongo shell, and the weapons begins to glow with an admittedly faint light.
P1: That's fairly convoluted, I'm not sure audiences will go for it.
P2: There are a lot of small obstacles that just lead from one to another, maybe would could try it as a montage?

## Confrontation

S: And so, the pair, weaker Mongo in hand, storm the Tower of Seven Windows, only to find, it is a trap. Perhaps it was the weaker weapon that left them vulnerable, perhaps the trap was unavoidable. But no sooner do they step inside than they are caged within an eof! 
P2: Now, Meteorite and the hero are supposed to be clever, wouldn't they see the trap coming?
S: It was an unexpected eof
P2: Ah.

## The Dungeons

S: So, imprisoned beneath the tower, our hero plans his escape. He doesn't know where Meteorite is being imprisoned, but he uses his VirtualBox to jimmy the lock, and secret his way from the dungeons into the Caves of Linux. But the caves, too, are full of dangers. 
S: He encounters his old friends Java and IntelliJ, that he knew from his childhood in the shadow of the tower. But here in the caves, they have been turned to stone, and won't wake up. 
S: Soon, the cave creatures take pity.

## Cliffhanger

P1: So, here's my problem. We're in the caves, and the screenplay just, ends?
